# API description
## Classes:
* Die
    * `__init__(self, face)`
        * `face`  (dtype: array) <br /> 
           Takes an array of faces as an argument. The array's data type (dtype) may be strings or numbers. <br /> 
           Internally initializes the weights to 1.0 for each face. 
    * `change_weight(self, face_value, new_weight)`
        * `face_value`  (dtype: string or number) <br /> 
           Takes two arguments: the face value to be changed and the new weight. <br /> 
           Changes the weights value of the face inputted.
        * `new_weight`  (dtype: float or dtype able to convert to float) <br />
           Takes a parameter of how many times the die is to be rolled. <br />
           Returns a list of outcomes.
    * `roll(self, amount = 1)`
        * `amount`  (dtype: numeric) <br />
           Takes a parameter of how many times the die is to be rolled; defaults to 1. <br />
           Returns a list of outcomes.
     * `show(self)` <br />
        Returns the dataframe created in the initializer.
* Game
    * `__init__(self, die_object)`
        * `die_object`  (dtype: list) <br />
           Takes a single parameter, a list of already instantiated similar Die objects.
    * `play(self, turns)`
        * `turns`  (dtype: numeric) <br />
          Takes a parameter to specify how many times the dice should be rolled. <br />
          Returns dataframe with roll number as a named index, the die number, and face rolled per instance
    * `show_game(self, dataframe, form = 'wide')`
        * `dataframe`  (dtype: dataframe) <br />
           A method to show the user the results of the most recent play. <br />
            Takes a parameter to return the dataframe in narrow or wide form. <br />
        * `form`  (dtype: string) <br />
            This parameter defaults to wide form. <br />
            This parameter should raise an exception of the user passes an invalid option. <br />
            The narrow form of the dataframe will have a two-column index with the roll number and the die number, and a column for the face rolled. <br />
            The wide form of the dataframe will a single column index with the roll number, and each die number as a column.

* Analyzer
    * `__init__(self, result)`
        * `result`  (dtype:dataframe) <br />
          Takes a game object as its input parameter. <br />
           At initialization time, it also infers the data type of the die faces used.
    * `jackpot(self)` <br />
        A jackpot method to compute how many times the game resulted in all faces being identical. <br />
        Returns an integer for the number times to the user. <br />
        Stores the results as a dataframe of jackpot results in a public attribute.
    * `combo(self)` <br />
       A combo method to compute the distinct combinations of faces rolled, along with their counts. <br />
        Compute the distinct combinations of faces rolled, along with their counts. <br />
        Stores the results as a dataframe in a public attribute. <br />
    * `face_counts_per_roll(self)` <br />
       A face counts per roll method to compute how many times a given face is rolled in each event. <br />
        Compute how many times a given face is rolled in each event. <br />
        Stores the results as a dataframe in a public attribute.


Each item should show their docstrings.
All paramters (with data types and defaults) should be described.
All return values should be described.
Do not describe private methods and attributes.
